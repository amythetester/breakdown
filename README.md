## Breakdown: by Amy Wyatt

## Overview
Breakdown was created as a Capstone project for Ada Developers Academy in Seattle. This app serves as a proof of concept for what could be a more featureful future app. This project allowed me to build an app on my own and explore new technologies. There are two main components of this app: 1) The frontend React App and 2) a custom API endpoint Lambda function.

This repository contains the React App while the Lamdba function code is hosted in AWS. The React App serves as the primary user experience while the Lambda function was responsible for taking location data, gathering the current weather information for that location, and providing users with recommended next steps with weather in mind.
